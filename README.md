# DispatchPulse-CE

Dispatch Pulse is a Home Grown [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) that is specifically tailored towards trades and other field service companies. It began simply as a time keeping program, but has expanded in scope since then.

Dispatch Pulse contains two primary modules:

* [Projects Scheduling, and Time](#projects-scheduling-and-time)—Time & Material Tracking Project Notes
* [On-Call Responder](#on-call-responder)—On Call Technician Notifications

This release is a open source version of Dispatch Pulse that anyone can use for their own use according to the [License](https://github.com/dsaul/DispatchPulse-CE/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). You may not resell this software as a managed or hosted service 
without opening up all associated code as well.

### Projects Scheduling, and Time

The Projects Scheduling, and Time module provides collaboration between disparate field service agents. Notes created by one agent, are immediately avaliable on other agents. Tracking labour and materials is extremely easy.

#### Seamless Collaboration
Store information about projects, clients, and contractors. Information instantly jumps from one agent to another. This reduces work stoppages as everyone will have the job details they need.

#### Labour & Material Tracking
Keep track of labour hours, either with punching start and finish, or by entering date and hours.

#### Service Call and Assignments Made Simple
Easily assign work to agents, with everyone seeing what is relevant to them. Store notes and work work completed.

#### Simple and Easy to Use
Dispatch Pulse uses the standard ["material design interface"](https://material.io), you'll feel right at home and get up and running in no time. 

#### Social Distancing
Help stop the spread of colds and sicknesses by reducing paper and other items exchanged.

### On-Call Responder

Do you wish that you could offer on-call services (plumbing, maintenance, locksmith, I.T., etc) and know that your representatives would get the message and not leave your customers hanging?

If your company offers 24-hour services, you need On-Call Responder.

Do you currently pay a outsourced call centre to answer your calls at night? Gone are the days of oursourced call centres, taking minutes to pick up, and charging you $200–$300 dollars per month to forward the caller's issue to the appropriate party.

On-Call Responder is an automated service which will pick up your on-call or emergency line, get the client's call back number, and make sure that someone at your company gets the message to have it actioned on.

You can see the details of each call, at each step. You are given all the data to ensure accountability. The time of not getting the message is in the past.
